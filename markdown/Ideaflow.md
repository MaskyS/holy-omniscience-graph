- [[Ideaflow]], at this [point in time]([[January 29th, 2021]]), is 
    - the organization that has the clearest picture of [[holy omniscience]] and everything the [[Holy Omniscience Graph]] stands for. 
    - Case in point:
        - > How can we solve problems too big to fit in any individual's head?

Ray Kurzweil projects that, by 2045, humanity will be hooked up to a "shared neocortex in the cloud" by brain-computer interfaces. We will leave the brain-computer interfaces to Elon Musk, but we believe itâ€™s possible to build that "shared brain" now, and that it might look different than many imagine.

We're starting by creating a notebook that augments the user's intelligence.

We want to create a future where nobody feels alone with their ideas, where intellectual soulmates find each other,  where superconnectors are empowered. We see our software as critical to creating the frame for humans and machines to work together to solve the world's most important problems.

- If I had to make a judgement from the demo, Ideaflow's [[Tools for Thoughts]] is actually better than [[Roam Research]] and anything else I've seen [so far]([[January 29th, 2021]]).
