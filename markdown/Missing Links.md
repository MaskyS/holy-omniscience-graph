- I think currently that putting these things together will unlock a bigger perspective: #questions
    - {{[[TODO]]}} How can we apply [[category theory]] to [[informetrics]]? What are the most important concepts from the former to understand?
    - {{[[TODO]]}} What are the most important works in [[graph theory]] or [[network theory]]? Which insights can we extract?
        - "{{[[TODO]]}} Read [[Linked: The New Science of Networks]]"
    - {{[[TODO]]}} What is most unclear about [[Free Hierarchy]]?
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Is it possible to represent information fractally?
    - {{[[TODO]]}} How can we facilitate creating free hierarchies of information from existing nodes? i.e. no-code for visualization engines, or feeds, or curation algorithms? Augmented curation and a marketplace of hierarchies/algos.
    - {{[[TODO]]}} What works can we dive into to understand the [[nature of information]]? 
        - [[Why Information Grows]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}}  How can we expose this gynormous roam db in such a way that 
        - isn't limited by manual organization
        - is easy to dive into + no hidden info
        - tries to allow [[perfect transclusion]]; spend less time copy pasting content or publishing on different platforms?
            - e.g. Twitter account can't schedule retweets right now. Wouldn't want to manually connect tweets hm.
