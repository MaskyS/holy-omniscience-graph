# ABOUT
    - [[The Information Platform of The Future]] is the medium and set of tools we will use to deal with information, as we do with the internet today. 
    - It is **not** a literal, centralized platform, but rather a fusion of modern solutions to perennial problems, one that will revolutionize how we discover, consume, and produce information— and that's only the beginning.
    - 
    - **The conceptual backbone of this platform is the theory of** [free hierarchies]([[Free Hierarchy]]). If you read only one thing in this graph, make it free hierarchies.
        - It's a vast theory, one that's worth exploring on its own; but a very short and incomplete explanation of its application is that
            - **we'll treat every unit of information as a node in a network (or hierarchy) and grant users the complete freedom to build, arrange, and expand these hierarchies.**
    - Our end goal is to achieve [[holy omniscience]], or [holy transparency]([[holy omniscience]]). ((Rest assured that the content in this graph will only be as religious as your interpretation of it.))
    - [[The Information Platform of The Future]] also enables two other [[holy ideas]], in quick succession: [[Holy Truth]] and [[Holy Origin]].

# STRUCTURE
    - This page will first and foremost focus on **ideas**, at random, for their timelessness. 
    - Then we go into tools and implementations to __illustrate the current execution progress of__ [[The Information Platform of The Future]].
    - I've tried to categorize/summarize everything into the six pillars below. but as you probably have realized by now, this graph is wildly interconnected. So the best way to exploit this chaotic Wonderland is to let yourself be led by your curiosity and exploring the  backlinks and ideas that interest you the most.
    - Lastly, if you're a really information-hungry person, you will be delighted to learn that a lot of content actually exists outside of these topic pages, in the Daily Notes.
        - This is because finding information happens faster than its organization. Interesting content instantly gets indexed there but putting it in context takes longer, thus ideas take a while to show up here. 
    - So if you've somehow managed to exhaust these ramblings, scroll through the daily notes.

        - Just another property per [[Free Hierarchy]], but an important one. 
        - "Search by all local events happening within the next hour that I might be interested in, which are hosted:
    by venues I have been to recently
    by foundations and projects I am supporting or following
    by people in my network
    about topics I am interested in" — [[Jonathan Borichevskiy]]
