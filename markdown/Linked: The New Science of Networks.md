- ## {{[[TODO]]}} Notes
    - The existence of hubs make it easier for other nodes to find a specific node
        - In the random model, you try to follow your hunch about immediate nodes, and with each step, your next move becomes vaguer
        - Asking the hub however has greater probability of leading you to the right path.
    - The web is unnatural for a complex network, because it isn't quite as small-world as the rest of them-- the network diameter is ~19, which is the highest observed iirc.
    - The web is also largely **unidirectional**. 
    - One side-effect of introducing bidirectional links to the web at large is that the network diameter will be reduced, and balance somewhat restored.
    - Truly central positions in networks are reserved for nodes that are simultaneously part of many large clusters.
    - The introduction of the idea of "fitness" feels like just creating a proxy for whatever factor that allows new nodes to overtake hubs, without actually explaining why; and the whole einstein-bose condensation section in 8th link sounds like a steaming pile of bull.
