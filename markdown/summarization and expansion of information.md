- **Why it's important**
    - The goal of [[summarization and expansion of information]] is 
        - to make it easier to find information related to what you are currently looking at, without being overwhelmed. In other words, it reduces [[Information Overflow]].
        - to make sure the information is transmitted in a language you understand- no jargon or ideas building upon concepts you don't know. In other words, it helps achieve [[Information/Knowledge Fit]].

- **What it is**
    - [[summarization and expansion of information]] is about putting things into context, your context.
    - It's the process we use to turn a book into a book summary into a blurb. It's the process [[Jacob Collier]] uses to [explain a musical concept in five levels of difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRkgK4jfi6M&list=PL_ssQmxKjCrT7muPsy7NiOJq1I5VyaiYl&index=165).
    - In [[The Information Platform of The Future]], this occurs automatically and universally, without a human having to reword the content.
    - To visualize how this would work, see [[The Future of Information]]'s [[Abstraction Slider]] and Content Augmentation sections.
    - Here's an inline version imagined by [[Matthew Siu]] (click to see entire thread):

- **Related/required ideas and example implementations**
    - [[[[GPT-3]] and its funny-talking AI friends]] will be doing most of the rewording. You can see a demo here:

    - Achieving [[Information/Knowledge Fit]] requires knowing what you know (and don't know) through [[Kiraman Katibin]]]].
    - It'll work best when paired with [[The Lyceum]] as well, since then it can more effectively guess what you want to know.
    - [[Roam Research]] has its [[collapsible parentheticals]], ((which I have been using throughout this graph,)) as you can see by clicking the Roam glyph.
- **Hardest problems/roadblocks to overcome**
    - [[abstractive summarisation]] is hard.
- **Dangers and limitations of a hasty implementation**
    - [[The Future of Information]] poses some excellent questions:
        - "How can we make sure [[Individual Media]] won’t be abused?"
        - "Will [[Individual Media]] grow or pop the Filter Bubbles of today’s world?"
        - "What will happen if no two people read the same text anymore?"
        - "When will we notice the impacts of [[Individual Media]]?"
        - "Who is responsible if the augmentation doesn’t reflect the author’s intent?"
