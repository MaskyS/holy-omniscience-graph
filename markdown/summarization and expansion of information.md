- **What It Is**
    - It's the process we use to turn a book into a book summary into a blurb. It's the process [[Jacob Collier]] uses to [explain a musical concept in five levels of difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRkgK4jfi6M&list=PL_ssQmxKjCrT7muPsy7NiOJq1I5VyaiYl&index=165).
    - In [[The Information Platform of The Future]], this occurs automatically and universally, without a human having to reword the content.
    - See one possible implementation in action in [[The Future of Information]]'s [[Abstraction Slider]] and Content Augmentation sections.
    - Here's an inline version imagined by [[Matthew Siu]] (click to see entire thread):

- **Why is it important?**
    - It helps reduce [[Information Overflow]],
        - which "is when finding information related to what you are currently looking at is really hard", "as defined by ".
    - It helps achieve [[Information/Knowledge Fit]]
        - https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/947516464025821184 #context #[[Information/Knowledge Fit]]
- **What other ideas does it require/interact with? Are there example implementations?**
    - [[[[GPT-3]] and its funny-talking AI friends]] will be doing the brunt of the work. You can see a demo here:
        - "https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1283211048145711104 #[[[[GPT-3]] and its funny-talking AI friends]] #[[summarization and expansion of information]] #[[Joscha Bach]]"
    - Achieving [[Information/Knowledge Fit]] requires knowing what you know (and don't know) through [[Kiraman Katibin]]]].
    - It'll work best when paired with [[The Lyceum]] as well, since then it can more effectively guess what you want to know.
    - [[Roam Research]] has its [[collapsible parentheticals]], ((which I have been using throughout this graph,)) as you can see by clicking the Roam glyph.
- **What are the hardest problems or roadblocks?**
    - [[abstractive summarisation]] is hard.
- **What are the dangers or limitations of implementing this principle alone/hastily?**
    - [[The Future of Information]] poses some excellent questions:
        - "How can we make sure [[Individual Media]] won’t be abused?"
        - "Will [[Individual Media]] grow or pop the Filter Bubbles of today’s world?"
        - "What will happen if no two people read the same text anymore?"
        - "When will we notice the impacts of [[Individual Media]]?"
        - "Who is responsible if the augmentation doesn’t reflect the author’s intent?"
