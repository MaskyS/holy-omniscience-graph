    - Why I want to work at Roam
        - to accelerate intellectual progress by building mental prosthetics :)
    - My learning process
        - I learn best when something surprises me, especially if the surprise promises to help or provide value to others. I enjoy self-directed learning, so I go where my curiosity takes me. But before jumping into something, I like to think: how else might I use this knowledge later? How it could possibly aid me or others in the long run?
        - Then, when something meets the criteria, I look at the paths others have taken, and try them out until I find something that works for me. When I'm unsure about the best approach to a problem, I consult the opinions of others; and when I'm stuck on a problem for too long, I try to get a pair of fresh eyes on it.
        - Usually the biggest struggle is holding on till all the jargon makes sense. So I'll figure out more ways to make learning a specific topic more visible in my environment, and to decrease the minimum effort to get involved. The more I learn, the more I can learn- when my repertoire of mental models grows, so does the number of associations I can create between ideas.
        - Here's a learning journey I pursued recently:
            - - Late 2020: Grew fascinated by graph-based search engines after discovering Atomic Search
            - - Had an very interesting discussion with the founders, who suggested to build a background in NLP and machine learning to dive deeper into this space.
            - - So I spent about a couple of weeks looking at books, video courses, and documentation about NLP and tools like spaCy to get a gist of the basics and the terminology.
            - - After that, I wanted to do something concrete, since NLP was so vast.
            - - I pulled up an idea I had written down a while back: a tool that created text summaries of Youtube videos so I could decide whether I should watch them.
            - - I decided I'd build this as a browser extension. So I learnt Typescript, Browser extension APIs, writing Google Cloud Functions in Python, and bundling it together-- through documentation, Youtube videos, blog posts.
            - - And a couple weeks later, YText was ready to use! I sent the demo back to Atomic's team, which they liked :)
