    - But beyond that, in terms of **principles**, I think tools for thoughts should have:
        - drastically reduce effort to capture thoughts and ideas
        - allow personal  definitions of truths and subjects to arise
        - Modularize thoughts even as you embed them into deeper and more intricate webs of knowledge
        - reduce redundancy
        - allow thought indenting in order to enable zooming in and out of details
        - effortless organization and finding of specific information
        - Integrate seamlessly with tools for production, generation, and consumption. 
            - Have no trouble creating pointers to knowledge outside the tool for example Twitter or Quotebacks
