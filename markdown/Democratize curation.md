- [[Everybody is a curator]], but most of it goes wasted
- No platform truly takes into account who the curator is and who the follower is. i.e. no skin in the game, no [[dual-authority judgement of information]] and little interest+social personalisation
- Exposing curation is hard and scattered.
    - Books: twitter threads, goodreads, blogposts, newsletters, instagram
    - [[Articles]]: social media, newsletters, blogs 
    - Why? Because no platform seamlessly integrates __consumption__, __personalisation__, judgement and "block-level" sharing. 
- Big Tech has a monopoly on algorithms:
    - - [[Spotify]] playlists
    - [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]] - basically untweakable beyond follows and muting
    - [[Twitter]] - follow, muting, retweet controls. There's lists but that's not the feed.
- Curation is largely ephemereal and one-dimensional due to a lack of [[Information distillation]] mechanisms
    - "best books I read in 2019"
    - "best threads from X"
    - value judged using vanity and unaligned metrics, i.e. likes and shares
- " [[The rise of community-curated knowledge networks]] by [[Sari Azout]], ((or as I like to call her, the woman who stole my brain,)) excellently showcases the intersection between [[Tools for Thoughts]] and social [[curation]]. #[[Knowledge Graphs]] #[[curation engine]]"
- Generate and expose taste profiles / filter bubbles
