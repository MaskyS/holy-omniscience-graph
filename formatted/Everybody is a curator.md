- All users are curators #[The Information Platform of The Future](<The Information Platform of The Future.md>) [curation](<curation.md>)
Three types of curators: 
    - creators (who generate their own content in addition to curations)
    - specialized taste-makers (go out of their way to explore and distill content)
    - and basic judgers (who just decide what they like, and even for that they might depend on the algorithm and other users).

- Don't believe me? Then why don't you look at what we do:
    - Patterns: Newsletters, Twitter Summary Threads, Book Notes/Second Brains → Condensation
    - Reviews/"Best X" Compilations: Anti-libraries, best books I've read, best movies I've watched, etc. → Curation/Recommendations
