- Currently, if you try to search on Google et al, it focuses on one questionâ€” what you're looking for.
- But we can do better. I think, there are at least three crucial [components of search](<components of search.md>):
    - __What__ I'm asking
        - is this a [convergent or divergent query]([convergent vs divergent queries](<convergent vs divergent queries.md>))?
    - __Whom__ I'm asking it
    - __Who__ is asking (for better matching)
- And then of course, there's __where__ I want you to look for answers.
    - For example, right now many users filter by twitter/reddit/stackoverflow results. As the web grows more interconnected, I imagine there will be preferences for certain spaces due to their format or culture.
