- **Why it's important**
    - The goal of [summarization and expansion of information](<summarization and expansion of information.md>) is 
        - to make it easier to find information related to what you are currently looking at, without being overwhelmed. In other words, it reduces [Information Overflow](<Information Overflow.md>).
        - to make sure the information is transmitted in a language you understand- no jargon or ideas building upon concepts you don't know. In other words, it helps achieve [Information/Knowledge Fit](<Information/Knowledge Fit.md>).
            - "https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/status/947516464025821184 [context](<context.md>) #[Information/Knowledge Fit](<Information/Knowledge Fit.md>)"
- **What it is**
    - [summarization and expansion of information](<summarization and expansion of information.md>) is about putting things into context, your context.
    - It's the process we use to turn a book into a book summary into a blurb. It's the process [Jacob Collier](<Jacob Collier.md>) uses to [explain a musical concept in five levels of difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRkgK4jfi6M&list=PL_ssQmxKjCrT7muPsy7NiOJq1I5VyaiYl&index=165).
    - In [The Information Platform of The Future](<The Information Platform of The Future.md>), this occurs automatically and universally, without a human having to reword the content.
    - To visualize how this would work, see [The Future of Information](<The Future of Information.md>)'s [Abstraction Slider](<Abstraction Slider.md>) and Content Augmentation sections.
    - Here's an inline version imagined by [Matthew Siu](<Matthew Siu.md>) (click to see entire thread):

- **Related/required ideas and example implementations**
    - [[[GPT-3](<[[GPT-3.md>) and its funny-talking AI friends]] will be doing most of the rewording. You can see a demo here:
        - "https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1283211048145711104 #[[[GPT-3](<[[GPT-3.md>) and its funny-talking AI friends]] #[summarization and expansion of information](<summarization and expansion of information.md>) #[Joscha Bach](<Joscha Bach.md>)"
    - Achieving [Information/Knowledge Fit](<Information/Knowledge Fit.md>) requires knowing what you know (and don't know) through [Kiraman Katibin](<Kiraman Katibin.md>)]].
    - It'll work best when paired with [The Lyceum](<The Lyceum.md>) as well, since then it can more effectively guess what you want to know.
    - [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) has its [collapsible parentheticals](<collapsible parentheticals.md>), ((which I have been using throughout this graph,)) as you can see by clicking the Roam glyph.
- **Hardest problems/roadblocks to overcome**
    - [abstractive summarisation](<abstractive summarisation.md>) is hard.
- **Dangers and limitations of a hasty implementation**
    - [The Future of Information](<The Future of Information.md>) poses some excellent questions:
        - "How can we make sure [Individual Media](<Individual Media.md>) won’t be abused?"
        - "Will [Individual Media](<Individual Media.md>) grow or pop the Filter Bubbles of today’s world?"
        - "What will happen if no two people read the same text anymore?"
        - "When will we notice the impacts of [Individual Media](<Individual Media.md>)?"
        - "Who is responsible if the augmentation doesn’t reflect the author’s intent?"
