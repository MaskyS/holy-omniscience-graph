## [Atlas Recall](<Atlas Recall.md>)
- - From what I understand Atlas captures screenshots for *every* window/screen/visited page, and sends them to their cloud. I imagine that entailed exponential server costs. UPDATE: It might not, if they did image differentials like [Savant Recall](<Savant Recall.md>).

## [Meta](<Meta.md>)
- But why isn't Meta building on Atlas? Well...the more I look at Meta, the more it seems like a ripoff of [Savant Recall](<Savant Recall.md>),
