- a [visual]([visualizer](<visualizer.md>)) [search engine](<search engine.md>) for finding local/cloud documents/files/texts/photos etc from your [usage history]([Perfect memory](<Perfect memory.md>)), started in [2016](<2016.md>) and shut down in [2017](<2017.md>)
- [My]([Kifah Meeran](<Kifah Meeran.md>)) Personal Postmortem
    - Cost of business far exceeded value captured. Why?
        - - Started off with a freemium model, and based off this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHDQLDYnfaU&list=ULZFL7xpKjYsQ&index=893) between the [CEO]([Jordan Ritter](<Jordan Ritter.md>)) and [Jason Calacanis](<Jason Calacanis.md>), they hadn't made up their mind on how to charge their customers, so they actually didn't implement the paid features part.
        - - From what I understand Atlas captures screenshots for *every* window/screen/visited page, and sends them to their cloud. I imagine that entailed exponential server costs
        - - They never seemed to have a defined target market. Sure, they mention enterprises a bunch of time 
    - But this really doesn't make sense to me. If money was the issue, wouldn't it make more sense to wrap up the public beta asap and start gathering paying users, rather than abruptly shutting down the service? Especially given the fact that this was a project in the works [since **2013**](https://cards.producthunt.com/cards/comments/383094?v=1). Something's wrong if you don't consider your software product worth paying for after 3-4 years of development.  
    - - searches only titles of documents
    - cant search notes or calendar content - despite mac being able to.
        - > Recall is rather spectacular when it comes to finding web pages you’ve seen, email you’ve read, PDF documents you’ve opened, and people you’ve opened in Contacts. It can call them up again instantaneously, and when you click Open, you’re returned to the actual web page (in your browser) or email (in your mail program).

Unfortunately, Recall isn’t as impressive at other kinds of documents. It does a great job of finding words you’ve had in chats—but when you click Open, **it opens up a screenshot of the relevant screenful of chat**, rather than opening the chat program and scrolling to the right place. It **does the same thing if you search for an Evernote page, or for an email that no longer exists**.

It’s even **worse at things like Microsoft Office documents, which it can find only by their titles**. It can’t seek inside of them, which is very odd—the Mac’s built-in Spotlight command can do that!

**Recall can’t find text in the Mac’s Notes app, Calendar, or Stickies. It can’t find text in Tweetbot**, my Twitter (TWTR) program. **It’s blind to what’s in page-layout files like Adobe (ADBE) InDesign.**
