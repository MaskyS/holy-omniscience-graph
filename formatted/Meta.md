- Meta is [Atlas Recall](<Atlas Recall.md>) 2.0
- UX is quite confusing though. But confusing is vague. I think there's a couple things Meta's makers fail to understand. In my ignorant opinion, what allowed [Atlas Recall](<Atlas Recall.md>) to be such a success was:
    - - Its focus on allowing users to define RELATIONSHIPS/properties of the entity we were looking for, i.e. type, time, etc, even if it was quite limited.
    - - It made use of VISUAL+SPATIAL arrangement. You could quickly transverse *multiple* results, and they were arranged in a 2d, associative manner, with all the text messages clustered in one corner, for instance. 
    - On the other hand, Meta is linear, whether in its search bar or its replay feature. 
- The more I look at Meta, the more it seems like a complete ripoff of [Savant Recall](<Savant Recall.md>), of which [Atlas Recall](<Atlas Recall.md>) was once accused of. I mean, the rewinding feature is there, the copy-text-from-frame feature is there, search too, although in Meta it is somewhat decoupled and is instead a [Spotlight Search](<Spotlight Search.md>) clone. 
- Interestingly, their [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/meta-extension/) extension page listing is in chinese + listed as experimental. 
    - https://www.gometa.com/privacy-information The number of typos in this document and way of wording strongly suggest that they were done by a non-native person.
    - By the way, [Atlas Recall](<Atlas Recall.md>)'s company, [Atlas Informatics](<Atlas Informatics.md>), was acquired by [Xinova](<Xinova.md>), which has quite a few west-asian [connections](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=["12901573"]).
- In total, ~400 [installs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-browser-extension-re/ofojdnfeldgockahabacmeehlgkclmpl?hl=en) on browsers, so can estimate max of 1000 beta testers.
