- **We are living through the emergence of a new business category that doesn‚Äôt even have a name yet, but which I believe will become an important part of our digital lives: online communities at the intersection of content curation and knowledge management.**
- In [Curators are the new Creators](https://gabygoldberg.medium.com/curators-are-the-new-creators-the-business-model-of-good-taste-5852727d4b54), [Gaby Goldberg](<Gaby Goldberg.md>) argues that this will create opportunities for curators ‚Äì increasingly, we will pay people with good taste to help us sort through the ever-growing mass of information.
- The business of good taste has been well documented. There are plenty of businesses that address the question ‚Äúwhat should I read?‚Äù; The Browser, Listory, Matter, Everything, to name a few.
- But thus far, the conversation around ‚Äúcuration‚Äù has been too focused on the content ‚Äì ‚Äúwhat should I read?‚Äù ‚Äì and not enough on the structure ‚Äì ‚Äúhow do we collect, store, and contextualize the information we consume?‚Äù We seem to have forgotten that the goal is not to consume more information. The goal is to think better, so we can achieve our goals.
- There‚Äôs a whole economy around knowledge organization available for the taking. 
- Three intersecting problems remain unsolved:
    - Our feed-based information architecture is obsessed with the present.
    - We consume information recreationally, not as a way to achieve our goals.
    - Curation has been too focused on the information and not enough on architecture; how we collect, store, augment, and utilize what‚Äôs already in our 
minds.
    - ## 1. "Our feed-based information architecture is obsessed with the present."
        - We seem to have accepted the job of the curator as providing a list of links with some commentary on an organized schedule. But this format is subject to the same accidental property of social media; ephemerality. 
        - Substack makes this worse. How often have you gone back to read an old issue of your favorite newsletter? Why bother when you‚Äôll have a new one soon? Without an information architecture that supports a longer shelf life for content, we will continue to accumulate mental and behavioral debt.
        - In the early days, Google helped us make sense of this abundance. I still remember when a Google search led to discovering personal blogs and hidden gems instead of results manufactured by SEO experts.
        - [Vicki Boykis writes: ](https://vicki.substack.com/p/google-and-the-nothing)
            - > Everything that Google has done to make people stay on the page and make results more accessible has resulted in a set of editorial decisions that mean we‚Äôre no longer getting straight search results that take us away from the page, but are in some kind of Upside Down Google Funhouse Internet where the content is brought directly to us, and the internet that is brought to us is stripped of context, of the richness of the pages on their own pages, wrapped up in Google‚Äôs business logic.
        - These days, we turn to places like Twitter and Substack to find things that people we trust find useful. But Twitter, which was originally conceived as a platform to post personal status updates under the prompt ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù, was never designed for the purpose of curating the world‚Äôs information stream. Their use-case was always one of obsolescence.  
        - What‚Äôs amazing is how chronological feeds ‚Äî essentially accidental experiments of digital architecture ‚Äî have rewired our brains. In the feed, everything is fleeting. This design property means you‚Äôre either always on and connected, or you‚Äôre off and wondering if you‚Äôre missing something important. 
        - In short, the architecture of digital platforms has made us obsessive documenters and consumers of the present, yet largely indifferent to the archives we create.
    - ## 2. "We consume information recreationally, not as a way to achieve our goals."
        - The architecture of digital platforms encourage us to consume information because it‚Äôs in front of us, not because it‚Äôs relevant. On Twitter, nothing has to be remembered, studied, applied, or reflected on. It‚Äôs an environment that promotes distracted thinking and superficial learning.  
        - The human brain is incredible at uncovering meaning, but is deficient at long-term memory storage. If we forget what we read, we can‚Äôt apply the knowledge to the problem at hand. We don‚Äôt need to read a long write-up on Figma‚Äôs winning strategy on a Wednesday at 11am when it hits our inbox, but we should be able to reference it if we‚Äôre building a company in the design tools space.
        - With our current tools, the burden of memory is left to the individual.
    - ##  3. "Curation has been too focused on the information and not enough on architecture; how we collect, store, augment, and utilize what‚Äôs already in our 
minds."
        - The conversation around curation thus far has focused too much on reducing the amount of information, and too little on what other architectures might be possible outside of the feeds or newsletters we‚Äôve grown accustomed to.
        - While technology successfully disrupted content production, the experience of consuming content remains unchanged ‚Äì the words have merely moved from a printed page to a screen.
- The Internet offers us the first major opportunity to introduce new, digitally-native information architectures that improve our understanding of the world through added context and relation. üëáüèΩ

- The past few years have seen the rise of many knowledge management tools, online communities, and curation businesses. But what‚Äôs interesting is how these categories are remixing into new combinations of content, community, and software.
- Let‚Äôs take a look at this diagram üëáüèΩ
    - ![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28271cd8-c858-4eb7-a5ac-bfbf8c2528e1_4608x3756.png)
- On the **curation** side, there are plenty of tools ‚Äì and creator businesses ‚Äì that facilitate content discovery and help us navigate abundance. As we‚Äôve addressed, these businesses often focus on the content at the expense of the structure.
- **Knowledge management** is becoming a hot topic again with the rise of tools designed to bring structure and order to our information stream (Anne-Laure Cunff has a great summary of the space [here](https://nesslabs.com/the-state-of-personal-knowledge-management)). These businesses take any forms, from single-player productivity tools designed for personal use (like MyMind](https://mymind.com/) and [Readwise](https://readwise.io/)), to multiplayer workplace collaboration tools (like Notion and Airtable). Instead of being a destination for reading content, these tools help people organize information.
- The intersection of **curation** and **knowledge management** is inhabited by **utility tools** like CB Insights ‚Äì destinations for both reading content and organizing information. Their biggest miss is that they [still function as hierarchies and have not tapped into the power of networked information (https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt) and **crowdsourced knowledge**.
- On the **community** side, we‚Äôre witnessing a shift towards a post-social media era defined by niche, gated communities of interest and purpose.
- Some content creators, such as [2pm](https://2pml.com/) and [Lenny‚Äôs Newsletter](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/), are blending curation and community to inhabit a space I call: **new media.¬†¬†**
- [Hunter Walk writes](https://hunterwalk.medium.com/coming-for-the-content-staying-for-the-community-started-with-video-games-or-maybe-religion-5083f3773a2):
    - > __I‚Äôm of the belief that ‚ÄúCome for the Content, Stay for the Community‚Äù will be one of the dominating themes for media this decade. As more creators  break away from companies to go subscription indie, they‚Äôll find it to be an effective and rewarding strategy to think of ways to build ‚Äòwhole is greater than the sum of its parts‚Äô experiences.__
- Most of these communities exist inside Slack, Discord, Telegram, or some other tool. But given the chat-based nature of these platforms, it‚Äôs easy to miss the best content. Without bespoke tooling to preserve knowledge, these communities will struggle with the same challenges of their early social media predecessors.
- The intersection of **community** and **knowledge management** is inhabited by spaces like [Genius](https://genius.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and other **collectively maintained libraries**.  Wikipedia is the pinnacle example here, and remains one of the greatest wonders of the Internet age, proving the value of bespoke tooling and the feasibility of collaboration at scale.
- The potential to build community-curated knowledge networks remains largely untapped. There are reasons to be optimistic; the [economic feasibility of paid communities](https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/), a renewed interest in curation, a [slow move away from big social](https://co-matter.com/post-social-media), and an improved understanding of platform incentives. All combined, this will lead to communities that are more sustainable, aligned, and intentional.

- As for the digital thing I‚Äôm building?
I‚Äôll have more to share ‚Äì and opportunities to get involved ‚Äì soon.
Stay real üôèüèº
