- **What is it?**
    - While you could argue that [Information Personalisation](<Information Personalisation.md>) is one part of [summarization and expansion of information](<summarization and expansion of information.md>), I use it here to refer to altering the presentation and transmission while preserving the **content**, i.e. facts, messages, principles.
- **Why is it important?**
    - One of the [biggest problems of e-learning](https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d) is retention. 
    - We can alter presentation to optimize for:
        - Entertainment
            - To make information entertaining is to increase its 'emotional' and 'motivational' charge to better match its importance, I.e. to maximize cost/benefit ratio.
        - Memorization
        - Learning/personality style
            - People's brains are undoubtedly different. This means that people learn, understand, and retain in different ways
    - What would this look like?
        - AI recreations of idols/heroes
            - [McKay Wrigley](<McKay Wrigley.md>) is building [Learn From Anyone](<Learn From Anyone.md>):

        - AI generated parables, stories, analogies, acronyms, memory palaces
            The bible is the most read book for a reason. A thread on the importance of fiction:

            Analogies, metaphors, and all the rest increase understanding, enjoyment, and memorization considerably. ((This should be intuitive, but I'd like to add a few citations here. Please recommend!!)). [The Information Platform of The Future](<The Information Platform of The Future.md>) should be able to leverage them.
            How? [GPT-3](<GPT-3.md>) can already write pretty good fiction, as demonstrated by [Gwern](<Gwern.md>) [here](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3).
        - Optimizing for learning/personality style
            - Employ Jung's cognitive functions or Big 5 data or different learning styles (visual vs kinesthetic vs imitative), rearranging as top-down vs bottom-up to optimize learning,
        - AI-assisted spaced repetition
        - Imagine using these techniques to present a trigonometry lesson that is as gripping as a Harry Potter book. What if you were a biology student, and GPT generated mnemonics or memory palace ideas for remembering the different parts of the brain?
