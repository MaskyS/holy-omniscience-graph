- I think currently that putting these things together will unlock a bigger perspective: [questions](<questions.md>)
    - [ ] How can we apply [category theory](<category theory.md>) to [informetrics](<informetrics.md>)? What are the most important concepts from the former to understand?
    - [ ] What are the most important works in [graph theory](<graph theory.md>) or [network theory](<network theory.md>)? Which insights can we extract?
        - "[ ] Read [Linked: The New Science of Networks](<Linked: The New Science of Networks.md>)"
    - [ ] What is most unclear about [Free Hierarchy](<Free Hierarchy.md>)?
    - [ ] Is it possible to represent information fractally?
    - [ ] How can we facilitate creating free hierarchies of information from existing nodes? i.e. no-code for visualization engines, or feeds, or curation algorithms? Augmented curation and a marketplace of hierarchies/algos.
    - [ ] What works can we dive into to understand the [nature of information](<nature of information.md>)? 
        - [Why Information Grows](<Why Information Grows.md>)
    - [ ] How can we expose this gynormous roam db in such a way that 
        - isn't limited by manual organization
        - is easy to dive into + no hidden info
        - tries to allow [perfect transclusion](<perfect transclusion.md>); spend less time copy pasting content or publishing on different platforms?
            - e.g. Twitter account can't schedule retweets right now. Wouldn't want to manually connect tweets hm.
