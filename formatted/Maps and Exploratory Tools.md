- These will identify connections between seemingly disparate fields and allow us to know where to look without getting overwhelmed.
- Through [Free Hierarchy](<Free Hierarchy.md>) we know that at their core, feeds, search engines, exploratory tools are actually the same thing- they retrieve information nodes based off certain properties, and then arrange them in different hierarchies that are (so far) usually linear.
    - So a feed is, in the end, is just a permanently recurring search from the info-emitting entities that have the "followed by X" property that arranges these nodes a linear hierarchy, usually prioritizing two properties- age (in reverse) and some vanity social signal like likes.
- What matters is
    - the sources being searched
        - FB's database vs Google crawled info vs consumption history etc
    - how discrete the specified properties are
        - "from x person" is more random than "contains this keyword"
    - the specified relationships between those properties/nodes
        - "contains this keyword" AND "from x person"
    - which purpose this hierarchy is achieving, and therefore, which arrangement it shall take, and which node properties will matter (if any).
        - "looking for most viewed nodes" etc

- [Engelbart](<Engelbart.md>) is a [visualizer](<visualizer.md>) [web app](<web app.md>) "that brings online conversations from [Twitter](<Twitter.md>) into a collective public space. Attention-driven algorithms push us towards people to follow, things to buy, ads to click. In relevance to social media, these algorithms drive us to echo chambers of people who share our same ideologies. Engelbart attempts to refute that by providing a space to view all Twitter activity in an empathic way. Follow Engelbart around in cyberspace to not only see what people are talking about, but how they're talking about it. Then, join in on the conversation yourself on Twitter." #[Maps and Exploratory Tools](<Maps and Exploratory Tools.md>)
