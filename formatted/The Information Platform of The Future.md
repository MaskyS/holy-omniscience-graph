# ABOUT
    - [The Information Platform of The Future](<The Information Platform of The Future.md>) is the medium and set of tools we will use to deal with information, as we do with the internet today.
    - It is **not** a literal, centralized platform, but rather a fusion of modern solutions to perennial problems. It will revolutionize how we discover, consume, and produce information.
    - 
    - Today, we have a unidirectional web of heavily clustered sites, people, and pages. [The Information Platform of The Future](<The Information Platform of The Future.md>) on the other hand, is a network of __blocks of information__ connected **bidirectionally**.
    - 
    - **The conceptual backbone of this platform is the theory of** [free hierarchies]([Free Hierarchy](<Free Hierarchy.md>)). If you read only one thing in this graph, make it free hierarchies.
        - It's a vast theory with many implications; but a very short and incomplete explanation of its application is:
            - every unit of information should be treated as a node in a network (or hierarchy) and grant users the complete freedom to build, arrange, and expand these hierarchies.
            - - every unit of information should be treated as a node in a network (or hierarchy)
            - - the __relationships__ between these nodes, and how they behave in various contexts, are more important than their intrinsic properties.
            - - users should have complete freedom to build, arrange, and expand these hierarchies, regardless of where the data/information was produced.
    - Today, we are privy from both our data and the algorithms used to get new information. Tomorrow, data will be detached from the platforms we use, and we'll have a whole marketplace of algorithms and hierarchies to process and arrange our information. 
    - Our end goal is to achieve [holy omniscience](<holy omniscience.md>), or [holy transparency]([holy omniscience](<holy omniscience.md>)). ((Rest assured that the content of this graph will only be as religious as your interpretation of it.))
    - [The Information Platform of The Future](<The Information Platform of The Future.md>) also enables two other [holy ideas](<holy ideas.md>), in quick succession: [Holy Truth](<Holy Truth.md>) and [Holy Origin](<Holy Origin.md>).

# STRUCTURE
    - This page will focus on **ideas** for their timelessness; then we go into tools and implementations ((to illustrate the current execution progress)).
    - I've tried to categorize everything into the six pillars below, but as you probably have realized by now, this graph is wildly interconnected. 
    - So the best way to exploit this chaotic Wonderland is to let yourself be led by your curiosity and exploring the  backlinks and ideas that interest you the most.
        - Lastly, if you're a really information-hungry person, you will be delighted to learn that a lot of content actually exists outside of these topic pages, in the Daily Notes.
            - This is because finding information happens faster than its organization. Interesting content instantly gets indexed there but putting it in context takes longer, thus ideas take a while to show up here. 
        - So if you've somehow managed to exhaust these ramblings, scroll through the daily notes.
