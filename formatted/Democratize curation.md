- [Everybody is a curator](<Everybody is a curator.md>), but most of it goes wasted
- No platform truly takes into account who the curator is and who the follower is. i.e. no skin in the game, no [dual-authority judgement of information](<dual-authority judgement of information.md>) and little interest+social personalisation
- Exposing curation is hard and scattered.
    - Books: twitter threads, goodreads, blogposts, newsletters, instagram
    - [Articles](<Articles.md>): social media, newsletters, blogs 
    - Why? Because no platform seamlessly integrates __consumption__, __personalisation__, judgement and "block-level" sharing. 
- Big Tech has a monopoly on algorithms:
    - - [Spotify](<Spotify.md>) playlists
    - [Facebook](<Facebook.md>), [Instagram](<Instagram.md>) - basically untweakable beyond follows and muting
    - [Twitter](<Twitter.md>) - follow, muting, retweet controls. There's lists but that's not the feed.
- Curation is largely ephemereal and one-dimensional due to a lack of [Information distillation](<Information distillation.md>) mechanisms
    - "best books I read in 2019"
    - "best threads from X"
    - value judged using vanity and unaligned metrics, i.e. likes and shares
- " [The rise of community-curated knowledge networks](<The rise of community-curated knowledge networks.md>) by [Sari Azout](<Sari Azout.md>), ((or as I like to call her, the woman who stole my brain,)) excellently showcases the intersection between [Tools for Thoughts](<Tools for Thoughts.md>) and social [curation](<curation.md>). #[Knowledge Graphs](<Knowledge Graphs.md>) #[curation engine](<curation engine.md>)"
- Generate and expose taste profiles / filter bubbles
