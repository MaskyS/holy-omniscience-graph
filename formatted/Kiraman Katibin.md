- > In [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) tradition the two **kiraman katibin**, are two [angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_view_of_angels) called **Raqib** and **Atid**, believed by Muslims to record a person's actions. Whether a person is sent to [Jannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannah) ([paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise)) or [Jahannam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahannam) ([hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell)/[purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory)) is not, however, dependent on whether good deeds outweigh bad deeds; but is ultimately up to [God's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Islam) mercy upon a believer. The [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran) refers to them in two places, and by name as ‘Noble Recorders'.
- Reincarnate the shoulder angels, and modernize them to record every productive action and consumption of each individual. 'God'—The seeker of truth (you)— uses the log to judge competency and truth.
- There's two goals:
    - Record all production and consumption
    - Putting together everything required for determining truth
- By logging what one consumes, one can signal expertise and taste. We use taste to decide what to listen to, and expertise to decide what to believe.
- Why record actions? It captures [your identity]([You Are Your Actions](<You Are Your Actions.md>)). It provides the [Proof of X](<Proof of X.md>). Show, don't tell. Consumption and production, __over time__, is heavily correlated with who you are:
    - - You are what you eat.
    - - [You Are The Average Of The Five People Around You](https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/you-are-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-spend-the-most-time-with-a2ea32d08c72)
    - - Tell me how X and I'll tell you who you are.
-  Consumption is hard to fake. You can't pretend to have read a book or watched a movie
