    - they also are very robust. They maintain their coherence; they hold together well, even under tough circumstances. They are balanced in this respect, between order and chaos. They are simple, yet also very complex.
 This balance is often referred to as "criticality," thus the title of the article: "Broadband Criticality." And the term "self-organized" is often added because systems tend to become fractal on their own, simply by putting a lot of system components together and allowing them to exchange information. Think of a party. All you need to do is come up with enough people at the same place and time and they will start to form complex patterns of connection with one another.
 Self-organizing critical systems are also very good at connecting, both internally and also to other surrounding systems. The branches of a tree are connected in a very lovely way. If you shake one branch, you'll see broad shaking across the tree. Fractal structures hang together nicely. Yet the branches may be trimmed without affecting the overall structure. Indeed, if you trim them far enough out (above the growth bud, "post-traumatic growth" or "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger") they will often grow even stronger, with more complex connections in the outer branches. Finally, branchlike patterns easily connect to other systems â€” a literal web of life. A tree with many fractal branches (and also roots) can better connect to the sun (and soil) to gather and exchange life-sustaining nutrients.

- By nature of being scale-free, or fractal, they become antifragile! When a node leaves a free hierarchy, latter is minimally affected, and in many cases, exit produces better hierarchies! [See]([Fractal Brains: Fractal Thoughts](<Fractal Brains: Fractal Thoughts.md>))
