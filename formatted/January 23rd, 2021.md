    - [Notes](<Notes.md>) #[Not finished](<Not finished.md>)
        - **[Thesis](<Thesis.md>):**
            - Interactivity is a curse for users and a crutch for designers. 
                - Software users' goals can be better satisfied through other means
            - [Bret Victor](<Bret Victor.md>) demonstrates crucial role of [information software design](<information software design.md>) ((the design of context-senstitive information graphics)) and presents three approaches to context-sensitivity. ((interactivity being the last one))
        - **[Claim](<Claim.md>):** Software design mainly involves [graphic design](<graphic design.md>) and [industrial design](<industrial design.md>).
            - **[Reasoning](<Reasoning.md>):** 
                - Users experience software via
                    - reading and intepreting pictures on the screen
                    - uses hardware as a proxy to interact with the objects on screen.
        - What is [graphic design](<graphic design.md>)?
            - It's the art of conveying a message on a two-dimensional surface
                - What type of messages?
                    - Messages can include identity, social status, emotion, persuasion
            - Which branch of graphic design is most relevant to software?
                - [Information Design](<Information Design.md>) - the use of pictures to express knowledge of interest to the reader
        - What makes a good graphic designer?
            - They understand how to arrange information on the page so the reader can ask and answer questions, make comparisons, and draw conclusions.
        - What is [industrial design](<industrial design.md>)?
            - The art of arranging and shaping a physical product so it can manipulated by people
                - What kind of products/objects?
                    - Cutlery to chairs, cell phones to cars.
        - What makes a good industrial designer?
            - They understand:
                - the capabilities and limitations of the human body in manipulating physical objects, 
                - AND
                - of the human mind in comprehending mechanical models.
            - They design an understandable mapping from physical features to functions
        - [Information software](<Information software.md>) serves the human urge to learn. 
            - A person uses information software to construct and manipulate a model that is internal to the mind—a mental representation of information.
            - Good information software encourages the user to ask and answer questions, make comparisons, and draw conclusions.
        - [Manipulation software](<Manipulation software.md>) serves the human urge to create. 
            - A person uses manipulation software to construct and manipulate a model external to herself—a virtual object represented within the computer, or a remote physical object.
        - communication can be thought of as 
            - creating a response to information learned—that is, the external model manipulated by the speaker is the internal model learned by the listener.
        - People using software do not __care __about artificial objects; they care about seeing information and understanding choices—manipulating a model in their heads.
            - I want to ask and answer questions, compare my options, and let it guide my spending decisions.
        - A well-designed information graphic can almost compel the viewer to ask and answer questions, make comparisons, and draw conclusions. 
            - It does so by exploiting the capabilities of the human eye: instantaneous and effortless movement, high bandwidth and capacity for parallel processing, intrinsic pattern recognition and correlation, a macro/micro duality that can skim a whole page or focus on the tiniest detail. 
            - Meanwhile, a graphic sidesteps human shortcomings: 
                - the one-dimensional, uncontrollable auditory system, the relatively sluggish motor system, the mind’s limited capacity to comprehend hidden mechanisms. 
            - A graphic presents no mechanisms to comprehend or manipulate—it plugs directly into the mind’s spatial reasoning centers.
        - most current software communicates deplorably. 
            - This is a problem of surface, but not a superficial problem. 
            - The main cause, I believe, is that many software designers feel they are designing a machine. 
                - Their foremost concern is behavior—what the software does.
            - These designers start by specifying __functionality__, but the essence of
information software is the __presentation__.
                - I suggest that the design of information software should be approached initially and primarily as a graphic design project. 
                - The foremost concern should be appearance—what and how information is presented. 
                    - The designer should ask: 
                        - What is relevant information? 
                        - What questions will the viewer ask? 
                        - What situations will she want to compare?
                        - What decision is she trying to make? 
                        - How can the data be presented most effectively? 
                        - How can the visual vocabulary and techniques of graphic design be employed to direct the user’s eyes to the solution? 
                    - The designer must start by considering what the software looks like, because the user is using it to learn, and she learns by looking at it.
        - Software overcomes the static restriction of print. it can- 
            - infer the context in which its data is needed,
            - winnow the data to exclude the irrelevant, and
            - generate a graphic which directly addresses the present needs.
        - Unlike conventional graphics, which must be suitable for any reader in any situation, a context-sensitive graphic incorporates who the user is and what exactly the user wants to
learn at the moment. 
            - Context allows software to 
                - winnow its data space to the subset of information that the user cares about, 
                - and 
                - present the data in such a way that the user’s current questions can best be answered.
            - There are, in fact, three sources from which software can infer context:
                - Environment involves sensing the current state of the world.
                - History involves remembering the past.
                - Interaction involves soliciting input from the user.
        - Interaction should be used judiciously and sparingly, 
            - only when the environment and history provide insufficient context to construct an acceptable graphic.
        - For information software in particular, all interaction specifies context. Thus, each interaction can and should result in a discernible change to a context-sensitive information graphic. 
            - Providing immediate feedback reduces the amount of manipulation the user must do before either reaching an adequate view or recognizing a wrong turn and backtracking.
