## [Meta](<Meta.md>)
- The more I look at Meta, the more it seems like a complete ripoff of [Savant Recall](<Savant Recall.md>), of which [Atlas Recall](<Atlas Recall.md>) was once accused of. I mean, the rewinding feature is there, the copy-text-from-frame feature is there, search too, although in Meta it is somewhat decoupled and is instead a [Spotlight Search](<Spotlight Search.md>)
